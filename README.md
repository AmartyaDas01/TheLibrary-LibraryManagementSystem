# TheLibrary-LibraryManagementSystem


This is my Final Internship Project For BEWD at TCR Innovations. Here, I have created a simple Library Management System by the name of 'The Library' using HTML, CSS and Django.

Before starting run in terminal:
py manage.py makemigrations
py manage.py migrate
py manage.py runserver

For The Library Admin Panel:
Username: amartyadas
Password: amartya123

For Django Admin Panel:
Username: adminlib
Password: tcrproject
